# P8: General Purpose Digital IO

P8 is one of only two GPIO pins with no assigned function or useful alternate feature on the micro:bit. You can use this pin in your projects or designs for any purpose.

## The Tech Specs

* Outputs 0V to 0.3V when LOW
* Outputs 2.7V to 3V when HIGH
* Reads 0V to 0.9V as logic LOW
* Reads 2.1V to 3V as logic HIGH
* Can source/sink a maximum of 5mA
* Tolerates -0.3V to 3.3V
* 11K - 16KOhm pull down/up resistance
* A maximum of 3 pins can drive 5mA at any one time

Note, voltages are given for a micro:bit powered over USB.
