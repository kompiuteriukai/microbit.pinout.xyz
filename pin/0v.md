# Ground (0V)

The Ground pins on the micro:bit are all electrically connected, so it doesn't matter which one you use if you're wiring up a voltage supply.

Generally the one that's most convenient or closest to the rest of your connections is tidier and easier, or alternatively the one closest to the supply pin that you use.
