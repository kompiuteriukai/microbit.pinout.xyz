The Kitronik Halo HD board for the micro:bit incorporates 60 individually addressable full colour ZIP LEDs, a MEMS mic, piezo buzzer, RTC and onboard battery holder!

It also breaks out P1 and P2 to a standard 0.1‚Äù footprint, it features a MEMS microphone for detection of sound, and a piezo buzzer to play sound. If that weren't enough, it also features an onboard real time clock (RTC) controlled by I2C lines from the microbit. The board also has two M3 mounting holes.
